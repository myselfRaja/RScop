      "Long waiting times silently frustrate customers and damage salon reputation. Here’s why waiting is no longer acceptable — and how smart scheduling fixes it.",

      <p>In most local salons, waiting has become so common that people think it’s normal. Customers arrive, sit down, scroll their phones, and wait — sometimes for 30 minutes, sometimes longer.</p>

      <p>But waiting is not free. It costs time, energy, and patience.</p>

      <h2>The Hidden Cost of Waiting</h2>
      <p>Students lose valuable study time. Working professionals lose rest hours. Many customers leave quietly and never come back.</p>

      <p>Salon owners also suffer — staff feels pressure, customers keep asking <b>“kitna time lagega?”</b>, and the environment becomes stressful.</p>

      <h2>Why Walk-In Systems Don’t Work Anymore</h2>
      <p>Walk-in systems worked when expectations were low. Today, people plan their day around time.</p>

      <p>Uncertainty creates frustration. Overcrowding creates mistakes.</p>

      <h2>A Simple Fix: Time-Based Appointments</h2>
      <p>When customers book a slot before coming, everything becomes predictable.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Less waiting</li>
        <li>Better staff management</li>
        <li>Happier customers</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Onligro</b> was built to solve this exact problem — respecting time for both customers and salon owners.</p>

      "Rush hours don’t have to mean chaos. Learn how online appointments help salon owners manage peak time smoothly without losing customers.",
    content: `
      <p>Rush hours bring customers — but unmanaged rush brings stress.</p>

      <p>Many salon owners believe more people sitting inside means success. In reality, it often means confusion, tired staff, and unhappy customers.</p>

      <h2>The Real Problem With Peak Hours</h2>
      <p>During rush time, staff gets overloaded and customers feel ignored. Some complain. Others silently leave.</p>

      <p>Both outcomes hurt long-term business.</p>

      <h2>Appointments Bring Control</h2>
      <p>Online appointment systems allow salon owners to see their entire day in advance.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Who is coming</li>
        <li>At what time</li>
        <li>For which service</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This clarity helps distribute workload evenly and reduce stress.</p>

      <h2>Better Experience = Repeat Customers</h2>
      <p>When customers know their exact slot, they arrive relaxed — not irritated.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Onligro is often described as a salon appointment system. But at its core, it’s something deeper.</p>

      <p>It’s built for people who value time.</p>

      <h2>Time Is the Same for Everyone</h2>
      <p>A student, a working professional, a business owner — everyone has the same 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Wasting time in waiting rooms affects productivity, mood, and daily planning.</p>

      <h2>Simple Technology for Real Life</h2>
      <p>Many tools are too complex for local businesses.</p>

      <p>Onligro focuses on simplicity:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Easy slot booking</li>
        <li>Clear schedules</li>
        <li>No confusion for customers or staff</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A Vision Beyond Salons</h2>
      <p>We believe local businesses deserve the same efficiency as big brands.</p>

      <p>Onligro starts with salons — and expands wherever time matters.</p>
